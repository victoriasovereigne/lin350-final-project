PRINCESS ROSETTE

ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen who had two beautiful sons
and one little daughter, who was so pretty that no one who saw her could
help loving her. When it was time for the christening of the Princess,
the Queen--as she always did--sent for all the fairies to be present at
the ceremony, and afterwards invited them to a splendid banquet.

When it was over, and they were preparing to go away, the Queen said to
them:

'Do not forget your usual good custom. Tell me what is going to happen
to Rosette.'

For that was the name they had given the Princess.

But the fairies said they had left their book of magic at home, and they
would come another day and tell her.

'Ah!' said the Queen, 'I know very well what that means--you have
nothing good to say; but at least I beg that you will not hide anything
from me.'

So, after a great deal of persuasion, they said:

'Madam, we fear that Rosette may be the cause of great misfortunes to
her brothers; they may even meet with their death through her; that is
all we have been able to foresee about your dear little daughter. We are
very sorry to have nothing better to tell you.'

Then they went away, leaving the Queen very sad, so sad that the King
noticed it, and asked her what was the matter.

The Queen said that she had been sitting too near the fire, and had
burnt all the flax that was upon her distaff.

'Oh! is that all?' said the King, and he went up into the garret and
brought her down more flax than she could spin in a hundred years. But
the Queen still looked sad, and the King asked her again what was the
matter. She answered that she had been walking by the river and had
dropped one of her green satin slippers into the water.

'Oh! if that's all,' said the King, and he sent to all the shoe-makers
in his kingdom, and they very soon made the Queen ten thousand green
satin slippers, but still she looked sad. So the King asked her again
what was the matter, and this time she answered that in eating her
porridge too hastily she had swallowed her wedding-ring. But it so
happened that the King knew better, for he had the ring himself, and he
said:

'Oh I you are not telling me the truth, for I have your ring here in my
purse.'

Then the Queen was very much ashamed, and she saw that the King was
vexed with her; so she told him all that the fairies had predicted about
Rosette, and begged him to think how the misfortunes might be prevented.

Then it was the King's turn to look sad, and at last he said:

'I see no way of saving our sons except by having Rosette's head cut off
while she is still little.'

But the Queen cried that she would far rather have her own head cut
off, and that he had better think of something else, for she would never
consent to such a thing. So they thought and thought, but they could not
tell what to do, until at last the Queen heard that in a great forest
near the castle there was an old hermit, who lived in a hollow tree, and
that people came from far and near to consult him; so she said:

'I had better go and ask his advice; perhaps he will know what to do to
prevent the misfortunes which the fairies foretold.'

She set out very early the next morning, mounted upon a pretty little
white mule, which was shod with solid gold, and two of her ladies
rode behind her on beautiful horses. When they reached the forest they
dismounted, for the trees grew so thickly that the horses could not
pass, and made their way on foot to the hollow tree where the hermit
lived. At first when he saw them coming he was vexed, for he was not
fond of ladies; but when he recognised the Queen, he said:

'You are welcome, Queen. What do you come to ask of me?'

Then the Queen told him all the fairies had foreseen for Rosette, and
asked what she should do, and the hermit answered that she must shut the
Princess up in a tower and never let her come out of it again. The Queen
thanked and rewarded him, and hastened back to the castle to tell the
King. When he heard the news he had a great tower built as quickly as
possible, and there the Princess was shut up, and the King and Queen and
her two brothers went to see her every day that she might not be dull.
The eldest brother was called 'the Great Prince,' and the second
'the Little Prince.' They loved their sister dearly, for she was the
sweetest, prettiest princess who was ever seen, and the least little
smile from her was worth more than a hundred pieces of gold. When
Rosette was fifteen years old the Great Prince went to the King and
asked if it would not soon be time for her to be married, and the Little
Prince put the same question to the Queen.

Their majesties were amused at them for thinking of it, but did not make
any reply, and soon after both the King and the Queen were taken ill,
and died on the same day. Everybody was sorry, Rosette especially, and
all the bells in the kingdom were tolled.

Then all the dukes and counsellors put the Great Prince upon a golden
throne, and crowned him with a diamond crown, and they all cried,
'Long live the King!' And after that there was nothing but feasting and
rejoicing.

The new King and his brother said to one another:

'Now that we are the masters, let us take our sister out of that dull
tower which she is so tired of.'

They had only to go across the garden to reach the tower, which was very
high, and stood up in a corner. Rosette was busy at her embroidery, but
when she saw her brothers she got up, and taking the King's hand cried:

'Good morning, dear brother. Now that you are King, please take me out
of this dull tower, for I am so tired of it.'

Then she began to cry, but the King kissed her and told her to dry her
tears, as that was just what they had come for, to take her out of the
tower and bring her to their beautiful castle, and the Prince showed her
the pocketful of sugar plums he had brought for her, and said:

'Make haste, and let us get away from this ugly tower, and very soon the
King will arrange a grand marriage for you.'

When Rosette saw the beautiful garden, full of fruit and flowers, with
green grass and sparkling fountains, she was so astonished that not a
word could she say, for she had never in her life seen anything like it
before. She looked about her, and ran hither and thither gathering fruit
and flowers, and her little dog Frisk, who was bright green all over,
and had but one ear, danced before her, crying 'Bow-wow-wow,' and
turning head over heels in the most enchanting way.

Everybody was amused at Frisk's antics, but all of a sudden he ran away
into a little wood, and the Princess was following him, when, to her
great delight, she saw a peacock, who was spreading his tail in the
sunshine. Rosette thought she had never seen anything so pretty. She
could not take her eyes off him, and there she stood entranced until the
King and the Prince came up and asked what was amusing her so much. She
showed them the peacock, and asked what it was, and they answered that
it was a bird which people sometimes ate.

'What!' said the Princess, 'do they dare to kill that beautiful creature
and eat it? I declare that I will never marry any one but the King of
the Peacocks, and when I am Queen I will take very good care that nobody
eats any of my subjects.'

At this the King was very much astonished.

'But, little sister,' said he, 'where shall we find the King of the
Peacocks?'

'Oh! wherever you like, sire,' she answered, 'but I will never marry any
one else.'

After this they took Rosette to the beautiful castle, and the peacock
was brought with her, and told to walk about on the terrace outside her
windows, so that she might always see him, and then the ladies of
the court came to see the Princess, and they brought her beautiful
presents--dresses and ribbons and sweetmeats, diamonds and pearls and
dolls and embroidered slippers, and she was so well brought up, and
said, 'Thank you!' so prettily, and was so gracious, that everyone went
away delighted with her.

Meanwhile the King and the Prince were considering how they should find
the King of the Peacocks, if there was such a person in the world. And
first of all they had a portrait made of the Princess, which was so like
her that you really would not have been surprised if it had spoken to
you. Then they said to her:

'Since you will not marry anyone but the King of the Peacocks, we are
going out together into the wide world to search for him. If we find him
for you we shall be very glad. In the meantime, mind you take good care
of our kingdom.'

Rosette thanked them for all the trouble they were taking on her
account, and promised to take great care of the kingdom, and only to
amuse herself by looking at the peacock, and making Frisk dance while
they were away.

So they set out, and asked everyone they met--

'Do you know the King of the Peacocks?'

But the answer was always, 'No, no.'

Then they went on and on, so far that no one has ever been farther, and
at last they came to the Kingdom of the Cockchafers.

They had never before seen such a number of cockchafers, and the buzzing
was so loud that the King was afraid he should be deafened by it. He
asked the most distinguished-looking cockchafer they met if he knew
where they could find the King of the Peacocks.

'Sire,' replied the cockchafer, 'his kingdom is thirty thousand leagues
from this; you have come the longest way.'

'And how do you know that?' said the King.

'Oh!' said the cockchafer, 'we all know you very well, since we spend
two or three months in your garden every year.'

Thereupon the King and the Prince made great friends with him, and they
all walked arm-in-arm and dined together, and afterwards the cockchafer
showed them all the curiosities of his strange country, where the
tiniest green leaf costs a gold piece and more. Then they set out again
to finish their journey, and this time, as they knew the way, they were
not long upon the road. It was easy to guess that they had come to the
right place, for they saw peacocks in every tree, and their cries could
be heard a long way off:

When they reached the city they found it full of men and women who were
dressed entirely in peacocks' feathers, which were evidently thought
prettier than anything else.

They soon met the King, who was driving about in a beautiful little
golden carriage which glittered with diamonds, and was drawn at full
speed by twelve peacocks. The King and the Prince were delighted to see
that the King of the Peacocks was as handsome as possible. He had
curly golden hair and was very pale, and he wore a crown of peacocks'
feathers.

When he saw Rosette's brothers he knew at once that they were strangers,
and stopping his carriage he sent for them to speak to him. When they
had greeted him they said:

'Sire, we have come from very far away to show you a beautiful
portrait.'

So saying they drew from their travelling bag the picture of Rosette.

The King looked at it in silence a long time, but at last he said:

'I could not have believed that there was such a beautiful Princess in
the world!'

'Indeed, she is really a hundred times as pretty as that,' said her
brothers.

'I think you must be making fun of me,' replied the King of the
Peacocks.

'Sire,' said the Prince, 'my brother is a King, like yourself. He
is called "the King," I am called "the Prince," and that is the
portrait of our sister, the Princess Rosette. We have come to ask if you
would like to marry her. She is as good as she is beautiful, and we will
give her a bushel of gold pieces for her dowry.'

'Oh! with all my heart,' replied the King, 'and I will make her very
happy. She shall have whatever she likes, and I shall love her dearly;
only I warn you that if she is not as pretty as you have told me, I will
have your heads cut off.'

'Oh! certainly, we quite agree to that,' said the brothers in one
breath.

'Very well. Off with you into prison, and stay there until the Princess
arrives,' said the King of the Peacocks.

And the Princes were so sure that Rosette was far prettier than her
portrait that they went without a murmur. They were very kindly treated,
and that they might not feel dull the King came often to see them. As
for Rosette's portrait that was taken up to the palace, and the King did
nothing but gaze at it all day and all night.

As the King and the Prince had to stay in prison, they sent a letter
to the Princess telling her to pack up all her treasures as quickly as
possible, and come to them, as the King of the Peacocks was waiting to
marry her; but they did not say that they were in prison, for fear of
making her uneasy.

When Rosette received the letter she was so delighted that she ran about
telling everyone that the King of the Peacocks was found, and she was
going to marry him.

Guns were fired, and fireworks let off. Everyone had as many cakes and
sweetmeats as he wanted. And for three days everybody who came to
see the Princess was presented with a slice of bread-and-jam, a
nightingale's egg, and some hippocras. After having thus entertained her
friends, she distributed her dolls among them, and left her brother's
kingdom to the care of the wisest old men of the city, telling them to
take charge of everything, not to spend any money, but save it all up
until the King should return, and above all, not to forget to feed
her peacock. Then she set out, only taking with her her nurse, and the
nurse's daughter, and the little green dog Frisk.

They took a boat and put out to sea, carrying with them the bushel of
gold pieces, and enough dresses to last the Princess ten years if she
wore two every day, and they did nothing but laugh and sing. The nurse
asked the boatman:

'Can you take us, can you take us to the kingdom of the peacocks?'

But he answered:

'Oh no! oh no!'

Then she said:

'You must take us, you must take us.'

And he answered:

'Very soon, very soon.'

Then the nurse said:

'Will you take us? will you take us?'

And the boatman answered:

'Yes, yes.'

Then she whispered in his ear:

'Do you want to make your fortune?'

And he said:

'Certainly I do.'

'I can tell you how to get a bag of gold,' said she.

'I ask nothing better,' said the boatman.

'Well,' said the nurse, 'to-night, when the Princess is asleep, you must
help me to throw her into the sea, and when she is drowned I will put
her beautiful clothes upon my daughter, and we will take her to the King
of the Peacocks, who will be only too glad to marry her, and as your
reward you shall have your boat full of diamonds.'

The boatman was very much surprised at this proposal, and said:

'But what a pity to drown such a pretty Princess!'

However, at last the nurse persuaded him to help her, and when the night
came and the Princess was fast asleep as usual, with Frisk curled up
on his own cushion at the foot of her bed, the wicked nurse fetched the
boatman and her daughter, and between them they picked up the Princess,
feather bed, mattress, pillows, blankets and all, and threw her into
the sea, without even waking her. Now, luckily, the Princess's bed was
entirely stuffed with phoenix feathers, which are very rare, and have
the property of always floating upon water, so Rosette went on swimming
about as if she had been in a boat. After a little while she began
to feel very cold, and turned round so often that she woke Frisk, who
started up, and, having a very good nose, smelt the soles and herrings
so close to him that he began to bark. He barked so long and so
loud that he woke all the other fish, who came swimming up round the
Princess's bed, and poking at it with their great heads. As for her, she
said to herself:

'How our boat does rock upon the water! I am really glad that I am not
often as uncomfortable as I have been to-night.'

The wicked nurse and the boatman, who were by this time quite a long way
off, heard Frisk barking, and said to each other:

'That horrid little animal and his mistress are drinking our health in
sea-water now. Let us make haste to land, for we must be quite near the
city of the King of the Peacocks.'

The King had sent a hundred carriages to meet them, drawn by every
kind of strange animal. There were lions, bears, wolves, stags, horses,
buffaloes, eagles, and peacocks. The carriage intended for the Princess
Rosette had six blue monkeys, which could turn summer-saults, and dance
on a tight-rope, and do many other charming tricks. Their harness was
all of crimson velvet with gold buckles, and behind the carriage walked
sixty beautiful ladies chosen by the King to wait upon Rosette and amuse
her.

The nurse had taken all the pains imaginable to deck out her daughter.
She put on her Rosette's prettiest frock, and covered her with diamonds
from head to foot. But she was so ugly that nothing could make her
look nice, and what was worse, she was sulky and ill-tempered, and did
nothing but grumble all the time.

When she stepped from the boat and the escort sent by the King of the
Peacocks caught sight of her, they were so surprised that they could not
say a single word.

'Now then, look alive,' cried the false Princess. 'If you don't bring me
something to eat I will have all your heads cut off!'

Then they whispered one to another:

'Here's a pretty state of things! she is as wicked as she is ugly. What
a bride for our poor King! She certainly was not worth bringing from the
other end of the world!'

But she went on ordering them all about, and for no fault at all would
give slaps and pinches to everyone she could reach.

As the procession was so long it advanced but slowly, and the nurse's
daughter sat up in her carriage trying to look like a Queen. But the
peacocks, who were sitting upon every tree waiting to salute her, and
who had made up their minds to cry, 'Long live our beautiful Queen!'
when they caught sight of the false bride could not help crying instead:

'Oh! how ugly she is!'

Which offended her so much that she said to the guards:

'Make haste and kill all these insolent peacocks who have dared to
insult me.'

But the peacocks only flew away, laughing at her.

The rogue of a boatman, who noticed all this, said softly to the nurse:

'This is a bad business for us, gossip; your daughter ought to have been
prettier.'

But she answered:

'Be quiet, stupid, or you will spoil everything.'

Now they told the King that the Princess was approaching.

'Well,' said he, 'did her brothers tell me truly? Is she prettier than
her portrait?'

'Sire,' they answered, 'if she were as pretty that would do very well.'

'That's true,' said the King; 'I for one shall be quite satisfied if she
is. Let us go and meet her.' For they knew by the uproar that she had
arrived, but they could not tell what all the shouting was about. The
King thought he could hear the words:

'How ugly she is! How ugly she is!' and he fancied they must refer to
some dwarf the Princess was bringing with her. It never occurred to him
that they could apply to the bride herself.

The Princess Rosette's portrait was carried at the head of the
procession, and after it walked the King surrounded by his courtiers. He
was all impatience to see the lovely Princess, but when he caught sight
of the nurse's daughter he was furiously angry, and would not advance
another step. For she was really ugly enough to have frightened anybody.

'What!' he cried, 'have the two rascals who are my prisoners dared to
play me such a trick as this? Do they propose that I shall marry this
hideous creature? Let her be shut up in my great tower, with her nurse
and those who brought her here; and as for them, I will have their heads
cut off.'

Meanwhile the King and the Prince, who knew that their sister must have
arrived, had made themselves smart, and sat expecting every minute to
be summoned to greet her. So when the gaoler came with soldiers, and
carried them down into a black dungeon which swarmed with toads and
bats, and where they were up to their necks in water, nobody could have
been more surprised and dismayed than they were.

'This is a dismal kind of wedding,' they said; 'what can have happened
that we should be treated like this? They must mean to kill us.'

And this idea annoyed them very much. Three days passed before they
heard any news, and then the King of the Peacocks came and berated them
through a hole in the wall.

'You have called yourselves King and Prince,' he cried, 'to try and make
me marry your sister, but you are nothing but beggars, not worth the
water you drink. I mean to make short work with you, and the sword is
being sharpened that will cut off your heads!'

'King of the Peacocks,' answered the King angrily, 'you had better take
care what you are about. I am as good a King as yourself, and have a
splendid kingdom and robes and crowns, and plenty of good red gold to
do what I like with. You are pleased to jest about having our heads cut
off; perhaps you think we have stolen something from you?'

At first the King of the Peacocks was taken aback by this bold speech,
and had half a mind to send them all away together; but his Prime
Minister declared that it would never do to let such a trick as that
pass unpunished, everybody would laugh at him; so the accusation was
drawn up against them, that they were impostors, and that they had
promised the King a beautiful Princess in marriage who, when she
arrived, proved to be an ugly peasant girl.

This accusation was read to the prisoners, who cried out that they had
spoken the truth, that their sister was indeed a Princess more beautiful
than the day, and that there was some mystery about all this which they
could not fathom. Therefore they demanded seven days in which to prove
their innocence, The King of the Peacocks was so angry that he would
hardly even grant them this favour, but at last he was persuaded to do
so.

While all this was going on at court, let us see what had been happening
to the real Princess. When the day broke she and Frisk were equally
astonished at finding themselves alone upon the sea, with no boat and
no one to help them. The Princess cried and cried, until even the fishes
were sorry for her.

'Alas!' she said, 'the King of the Peacocks must have ordered me to be
thrown into the sea because he had changed his mind and did not want to
marry me. But how strange of him, when I should have loved him so much,
and we should have been so happy together!'

And then she cried harder than ever, for she could not help still loving
him. So for two days they floated up and down the sea, wet and shivering
with the cold, and so hungry that when the Princess saw some oysters she
caught them, and she and Frisk both ate some, though they didn't like
them at all. When night came the Princess was so frightened that she
said to Frisk:

'Oh! Do please keep on barking for fear the soles should come and eat us
up!'

Now it happened that they had floated close in to the shore, where a
poor old man lived all alone in a little cottage. When he heard Frisk's
barking he thought to himself:

'There must have been a shipwreck!' (for no dogs ever passed that way by
any chance), and he went out to see if he could be of any use. He soon
saw the Princess and Frisk floating up and down, and Rosette, stretching
out her hands to him, cried:

'Oh! Good old man, do save me, or I shall die of cold and hunger!'

When he heard her cry out so piteously he was very sorry for her, and
ran back into his house to fetch a long boat-hook. Then he waded into
the water up to his chin, and after being nearly drowned once or twice
he at last succeeded in getting hold of the Princess's bed and dragging
it on shore.

Rosette and Frisk were joyful enough to find themselves once more on
dry land, and the Princess thanked the old man heartily; then, wrapping
herself up in her blankets, she daintily picked her way up to the
cottage on her little bare feet. There the old man lighted a fire of
straw, and then drew from an old box his wife's dress and shoes,
which the Princess put on, and thus roughly clad looked as charming as
possible, and Frisk danced his very best to amuse her.

The old man saw that Rosette must be some great lady, for her bed
coverings were all of satin and gold. He begged that she would tell him
all her history, as she might safely trust him. The Princess told him
everything, weeping bitterly again at the thought that it was by the
King's orders that she had been thrown overboard.

'And now, my daughter, what is to be done?' said the old man. 'You are a
great Princess, accustomed to fare daintily, and I have nothing to offer
you but black bread and radishes, which will not suit you at all. Shall
I go and tell the King of the Peacocks that you are here? If he sees you
he will certainly wish to marry you.'

'Oh no!' cried Rosette, 'he must be wicked, since he tried to drown me.
Don't let us tell him, but if you have a little basket give it to me.'

The old man gave her a basket, and tying it round Frisk's neck she said
to him: 'Go and find out the best cooking-pot in the town and bring the
contents to me.'

Away went Frisk, and as there was no better dinner cooking in all the
town than the King's, he adroitly took the cover off the pot and brought
all it contained to the Princess, who said:

'Now go back to the pantry, and bring the best of everything you find
there.'

So Frisk went back and filled his basket with white bread, and red wine,
and every kind of sweetmeat, until it was almost too heavy for him to
carry.

When the King of the Peacocks wanted his dinner there was nothing in the
pot and nothing in the pantry. All the courtiers looked at one another
in dismay, and the King was terribly cross.

'Oh well! 'he said, 'if there is no dinner I cannot dine, but take care
that plenty of things are roasted for supper.'

When evening came the Princess said to Frisk:

'Go into the town and find out the best kitchen, and bring me all the
nicest morsels that are being roasted upon the spit.'

Frisk did as he was told, and as he knew of no better kitchen than the
King's, he went in softly, and when the cook's back was turned took
everything that was upon the spit, As it happened it was all done to
a turn, and looked so good that it made him hungry only to see it. He
carried his basket to the Princess, who at once sent him back to the
pantry to bring all the tarts and sugar plums that had been prepared for
the King's supper.

The King, as he had had no dinner, was very hungry and wanted his supper
early, but when he asked for it, lo and behold it was all gone, and he
had to go to bed half-starved and in a terrible temper. The next day the
same thing happened, and the next, so that for three days the King got
nothing at all to eat, because just when the dinner or the supper
was ready to be served it mysteriously disappeared. At last the Prime
Minister began to be afraid that the King would be starved to death,
so he resolved to hide himself in some dark corner of the kitchen, and
never take his eyes off the cooking-pot. His surprise was great when
he presently saw a little green dog with one ear slip softly into the
kitchen, uncover the pot, transfer all its contents to his basket,
and run off. The Prime Minister followed hastily, and tracked him all
through the town to the cottage of the good old man; then he ran back
to the King and told him that he had found out where all his dinners
and suppers went. The King, who was very much astonished, said he should
like to go and see for himself. So he set out, accompanied by the Prime
Minister and a guard of archers, and arrived just in time to find the
old man and the Princess finishing his dinner.

The King ordered that they should be seized and bound with ropes, and
Frisk also.

When they were brought back to the palace some one told the King, who
said:

'To-day is the last day of the respite granted to those impostors; they
shall have their heads cut off at the same time as these stealers of
my dinner.' Then the old man went down on his knees before the King and
begged for time to tell him everything. While he spoke the King for the
first time looked attentively at the Princess, because he was sorry to
see how she cried, and when he heard the old man saying that her name
was Rosette, and that she had been treacherously thrown into the sea, he
turned head over heels three times without stopping, in spite of being
quite weak from hunger, and ran to embrace her, and untied the ropes
which bound her with his own hands, declaring that he loved her with all
his heart.

Messengers were sent to bring the Princes out of prison, and they came
very sadly, believing that they were to be executed at once: the nurse
and her daughter and the boatman were brought also. As soon as they
came in Rosette ran to embrace her brothers, while the traitors threw
themselves down before her and begged for mercy. The King and the
Princess were so happy that they freely forgave them, and as for the
good old man he was splendidly rewarded, and spent the rest of his days
in the palace. The King of the Peacocks made ample amends to the
King and Prince for the way in which they had been treated, and did
everything in his power to show how sorry he was.

The nurse restored to Rosette all her dresses and jewels, and the bushel
of gold pieces; the wedding was held at once, and they all lived happily
ever after--even to Frisk, who enjoyed the greatest luxury, and never
had anything worse than the wing of a partridge for dinner all the rest
of his life.(7)

THE ENCHANTED PIG

ONCE upon a time there lived a King who had three daughters. Now it
happened that he had to go out to battle, so he called his daughters and
said to them:

'My dear children, I am obliged to go to the wars. The enemy is
approaching us with a large army. It is a great grief to me to leave you
all. During my absence take care of yourselves and be good girls; behave
well and look after everything in the house. You may walk in the garden,
and you may go into all the rooms in the palace, except the room at the
back in the right-hand corner; into that you must not enter, for harm
would befall you.'

'You may keep your mind easy, father,' they replied. 'We have never
been disobedient to you. Go in peace, and may heaven give you a glorious
victory!'

When everything was ready for his departure, the King gave them the keys
of all the rooms and reminded them once more of what he had said. His
daughters kissed his hands with tears in their eyes, and wished him
prosperity, and he gave the eldest the keys.

Now when the girls found themselves alone they felt so sad and dull that
they did not know what to do. So, to pass the time, they decided to
work for part of the day, to read for part of the day, and to enjoy
themselves in the garden for part of the day. As long as they did this
all went well with them. But this happy state of things did not last
long. Every day they grew more and more curious, and you will see what
the end of that was.

'Sisters,' said the eldest Princess, 'all day long we sew, spin, and
read. We have been several days quite alone, and there is no corner of
the garden that we have not explored. We have been in all the rooms of
our father's palace, and have admired the rich and beautiful furniture:
why should not we go into the room that our father forbad us to enter?'

Sister,' said the youngest, 'I cannot think how you can tempt us to
break our father's command. When he told us not to go into that room
he must have known what he was saying, and have had a good reason for
saying it.'

'Surely the sky won't fall about our heads if we DO go in,' said the
second Princess. 'Dragons and such like monsters that would devour us
will not be hidden in the room. And how will our father ever find out
that we have gone in?'

While they were speaking thus, encouraging each other, they had reached
the room; the eldest fitted the key into the lock, and snap! the door
stood open.

The three girls entered, and what do you think they saw?

The room was quite empty, and without any ornament, but in the middle
stood a large table, with a gorgeous cloth, and on it lay a big open
book.

Now the Princesses were curious to know what was written in the book,
especially the eldest, and this is what she read:

'The eldest daughter of this King will marry a prince from the East.'

Then the second girl stepped forward, and turning over the page she
read:

'The second daughter of this King will marry a prince from the West.'

The girls were delighted, and laughed and teased each other.

But the youngest Princess did not want to go near the table or to open
the book. Her elder sisters however left her no peace, and will she,
nill she, they dragged her up to the table, and in fear and trembling
she turned over the page and read:

'The youngest daughter of this King will be married to a pig from the
North.'

Now if a thunderbolt had fallen upon her from heaven it would not have
frightened her more.

She almost died of misery, and if her sisters had not held her up, she
would have sunk to the ground and cut her head open.

When she came out of the fainting fit into which she had fallen in her
terror, her sisters tried to comfort her, saying:

'How can you believe such nonsense? When did it ever happen that a
king's daughter married a pig?'

'What a baby you are!' said the other sister; 'has not our father enough
soldiers to protect you, even if the disgusting creature did come to woo
you?'

The youngest Princess would fain have let herself be convinced by her
sisters' words, and have believed what they said, but her heart was
heavy. Her thoughts kept turning to the book, in which stood written
that great happiness waited her sisters, but that a fate was in store
for her such as had never before been known in the world.

Besides, the thought weighed on her heart that she had been guilty of
disobeying her father. She began to get quite ill, and in a few days she
was so changed that it was difficult to recognise her; formerly she had
been rosy and merry, now she was pale and nothing gave her any pleasure.
She gave up playing with her sisters in the garden, ceased to gather
flowers to put in her hair, and never sang when they sat together at
their spinning and sewing.

In the meantime the King won a great victory, and having completely
defeated and driven off the enemy, he hurried home to his daughters, to
whom his thoughts had constantly turned. Everyone went out to meet him
with cymbals and fifes and drums, and there was great rejoicing over his
victorious return. The King's first act on reaching home was to thank
Heaven for the victory he had gained over the enemies who had risen
against him. He then entered his palace, and the three Princesses
stepped forward to meet him. His joy was great when he saw that they
were all well, for the youngest did her best not to appear sad.

In spite of this, however, it was not long before the King noticed that
his third daughter was getting very thin and sad-looking. And all of a
sudden he felt as if a hot iron were entering his soul, for it flashed
through his mind that she had disobeyed his word. He felt sure he
was right; but to be quite certain he called his daughters to him,
questioned them, and ordered them to speak the truth. They confessed
everything, but took good care not to say which had led the other two
into temptation.

The King was so distressed when he heard it that he was almost overcome
by grief. But he took heart and tried to comfort his daughters, who
looked frightened to death. He saw that what had happened had happened,
and that a thousand words would not alter matters by a hair's-breadth.

Well, these events had almost been forgotten when one fine day a prince
from the East appeared at the Court and asked the King for the hand of
his eldest daughter. The King gladly gave his consent. A great wedding
banquet was prepared, and after three days of feasting the happy pair
were accompanied to the frontier with much ceremony and rejoicing.

After some time the same thing befell the second daughter, who was wooed
and won by a prince from the West.

Now when the young Princess saw that everything fell out exactly as had
been written in the book, she grew very sad. She refused to eat, and
would not put on her fine clothes nor go out walking, and declared that
she would rather die than become a laughing-stock to the world. But the
King would not allow her to do anything so wrong, and he comforted her
in all possible ways.

So the time passed, till lo and behold! one fine day an enormous pig
from the North walked into the palace, and going straight up to the
King said, 'Hail! oh King. May your life be as prosperous and bright as
sunrise on a clear day!'

'I am glad to see you well, friend,' answered the King, 'but what wind
has brought you hither?'

'I come a-wooing,' replied the Pig.

Now the King was astonished to hear so fine a speech from a Pig, and at
once it occurred to him that something strange was the matter. He would
gladly have turned the Pig's thoughts in another direction, as he did
not wish to give him the Princess for a wife; but when he heard that the
Court and the whole street were full of all the pigs in the world he saw
that there was no escape, and that he must give his consent. The Pig was
not satisfied with mere promises, but insisted that the wedding should
take place within a week, and would not go away till the King had sworn
a royal oath upon it.

The King then sent for his daughter, and advised her to submit to fate,
as there was nothing else to be done. And he added:

'My child, the words and whole behaviour of this Pig are quite unlike
those of other pigs. I do not myself believe that he always was a pig.
Depend upon it some magic or witchcraft has been at work. Obey him, and
do everything that he wishes, and I feel sure that Heaven will shortly
send you release.'

'If you wish me to do this, dear father, I will do it,' replied the
girl.

In the meantime the wedding-day drew near. After the marriage, the Pig
and his bride set out for his home in one of the royal carriages. On the
way they passed a great bog, and the Pig ordered the carriage to stop,
and got out and rolled about in the mire till he was covered with mud
from head to foot; then he got back into the carriage and told his wife
to kiss him. What was the poor girl to do? She bethought herself of her
father's words, and, pulling out her pocket handkerchief, she gently
wiped the Pig's snout and kissed it.

By the time they reached the Pig's dwelling, which stood in a thick
wood, it was quite dark. They sat down quietly for a little, as they
were tired after their drive; then they had supper together, and lay
down to rest. During the night the Princess noticed that the Pig had
changed into a man. She was not a little surprised, but remembering her
father's words, she took courage, determined to wait and see what would
happen.

And now she noticed that every night the Pig became a man, and every
morning he was changed into a Pig before she awoke. This happened
several nights running, and the Princess could not understand it at all.
Clearly her husband must be bewitched. In time she grew quite fond of
him, he was so kind and gentle.

One fine day as she was sitting alone she saw an old witch go past. She
felt quite excited, as it was so long since she had seen a human being,
and she called out to the old woman to come and talk to her. Among other
things the witch told her that she understood all magic arts, and that
she could foretell the future, and knew the healing powers of herbs and
plants.

'I shall be grateful to you all my life, old dame,' said the Princess,
'if you will tell me what is the matter with my husband. Why is he a Pig
by day and a human being by night?'

'I was just going to tell you that one thing, my dear, to show you what
a good fortune-teller I am. If you like, I will give you a herb to break
the spell.'

'If you will only give it to me,' said the Princess, 'I will give you
anything you choose to ask for, for I cannot bear to see him in this
state.'

'Here, then, my dear child,' said the witch, 'take this thread, but
do not let him know about it, for if he did it would lose its healing
power. At night, when he is asleep, you must get up very quietly, and
fasten the thread round his left foot as firmly as possible; and you
will see in the morning he will not have changed back into a Pig, but
will still be a man. I do not want any reward. I shall be sufficiently
repaid by knowing that you are happy. It almost breaks my heart to think
of all you have suffered, and I only wish I had known it sooner, as I
should have come to your rescue at once.'

When the old witch had gone away the Princess hid the thread very
carefully, and at night she got up quietly, and with a beating heart she
bound the thread round her husband's foot. Just as she was pulling the
knot tight there was a crack, and the thread broke, for it was rotten.

Her husband awoke with a start, and said to her, 'Unhappy woman, what
have you done? Three days more and this unholy spell would have fallen
from me, and now, who knows how long I may have to go about in this
disgusting shape? I must leave you at once, and we shall not meet again
until you have worn out three pairs of iron shoes and blunted a steel
staff in your search for me.' So saying he disappeared.

Now, when the Princess was left alone she began to weep and moan in a
way that was pitiful to hear; but when she saw that her tears and groans
did her no good, she got up, determined to go wherever fate should lead
her.

On reaching a town, the first thing she did was to order three pairs of
iron sandals and a steel staff, and having made these preparations
for her journey, she set out in search of her husband. On and on she
wandered over nine seas and across nine continents; through forests with
trees whose stems were as thick as beer-barrels; stumbling and knocking
herself against the fallen branches, then picking herself up and going
on; the boughs of the trees hit her face, and the shrubs tore her hands,
but on she went, and never looked back. At last, wearied with her long
journey and worn out and overcome with sorrow, but still with hope at
her heart, she reached a house.

Now who do you think lived there? The Moon.

The Princess knocked at the door, and begged to be let in that she might
rest a little. The mother of the Moon, when she saw her sad plight, felt
a great pity for her, and took her in and nursed and tended her. And
while she was here the Princess had a little baby.

One day the mother of the Moon asked her:

'How was it possible for you, a mortal, to get hither to the house of
the Moon?'

Then the poor Princess told her all that happened to her, and added 'I
shall always be thankful to Heaven for leading me hither, and grateful
to you that you took pity on me and on my baby, and did not leave us to
die. Now I beg one last favour of you; can your daughter, the Moon, tell
me where my husband is?'

'She cannot tell you that, my child,' replied the goddess, 'but, if you
will travel towards the East until you reach the dwelling of the Sun, he
may be able to tell you something.'

Then she gave the Princess a roast chicken to eat, and warned her to
be very careful not to lose any of the bones, because they might be of
great use to her.

When the Princess had thanked her once more for her hospitality and for
her good advice, and had thrown away one pair of shoes that were worn
out, and had put on a second pair, she tied up the chicken bones in a
bundle, and taking her baby in her arms and her staff in her hand, she
set out once more on her wanderings.

On and on and on she went across bare sandy deserts, where the roads
were so heavy that for every two steps that she took forwards she fell
back one; but she struggled on till she had passed these dreary plains;
next she crossed high rocky mountains, jumping from crag to crag and
from peak to peak. Sometimes she would rest for a little on a mountain,
and then start afresh always farther and farther on. She had to cross
swamps and to scale mountain peaks covered with flints, so that her feet
and knees and elbows were all torn and bleeding, and sometimes she came
to a precipice across which she could not jump, and she had to crawl
round on hands and knees, helping herself along with her staff. At
length, wearied to death, she reached the palace in which the Sun lived.
She knocked and begged for admission. The mother of the Sun opened the
door, and was astonished at beholding a mortal from the distant earthly
shores, and wept with pity when she heard of all she had suffered. Then,
having promised to ask her son about the Princess's husband, she hid her
in the cellar, so that the Sun might notice nothing on his return home,
for he was always in a bad temper when he came in at night. The next day
the Princess feared that things would not go well with her, for the Sun
had noticed that some one from the other world had been in the palace.
But his mother had soothed him with soft words, assuring him that this
was not so. So the Princess took heart when she saw how kindly she was
treated, and asked:

'But how in the world is it possible for the Sun to be angry? He is so
beautiful and so good to mortals.'

'This is how it happens,' replied the Sun's mother. 'In the morning
when he stands at the gates of paradise he is happy, and smiles on the
whole world, but during the day he gets cross, because he sees all the
evil deeds of men, and that is why his heat becomes so scorching; but
in the evening he is both sad and angry, for he stands at the gates of
death; that is his usual course. From there he comes back here.'

She then told the Princess that she had asked about her hus-band, but
that her son had replied that he knew nothing about him, and that her
only hope was to go and inquire of the Wind.

Before the Princess left the mother of the Sun gave her a roast chicken
to eat, and advised her to take great care of the bones, which she did,
wrapping them up in a bundle. She then threw away her second pair of
shoes, which were quite worn out, and with her child on her arm and her
staff in her hand, she set forth on her way to the Wind.

In these wanderings she met with even greater difficulties than before,
for she came upon one mountain of flints after another, out of which
tongues of fire would flame up; she passed through woods which had
never been trodden by human foot, and had to cross fields of ice and
avalanches of snow. The poor woman nearly died of these hardships, but
she kept a brave heart, and at length she reached an enormous cave
in the side of a mountain. This was where the Wind lived. There was a
little door in the railing in front of the cave, and here the Princess
knocked and begged for admission. The mother of the Wind had pity on her
and took her in, that she might rest a little. Here too she was hidden
away, so that the Wind might not notice her.

The next morning the mother of the Wind told her that her husband was
living in a thick wood, so thick that no axe had been able to cut a way
through it; here he had built himself a sort of house by placing trunks
of trees together and fastening them with withes and here he lived
alone, shunning human kind.

After the mother of the Wind had given the Princess a chicken to eat,
and had warned her to take care of the bones, she advised her to go by
the Milky Way, which at night lies across the sky, and to wander on till
she reached her goal.

Having thanked the old woman with tears in her eyes for her hospitality,
and for the good news she had given her, the Princess set out on her
journey and rested neither night nor day, so great was her longing to
see her husband again. On and on she walked until her last pair of shoes
fell in pieces. So she threw them away and went on with bare feet, not
heeding the bogs nor the thorns that wounded her, nor the stones that
bruised her. At last she reached a beautiful green meadow on the edge of
a wood. Her heart was cheered by the sight of the flowers and the soft
cool grass, and she sat down and rested for a little. But hearing
the birds chirping to their mates among the trees made her think with
longing of her husband, and she wept bitterly, and taking her child in
her arms, and her bundle of chicken bones on her shoulder, she entered
the wood.

For three days and three nights she struggled through it, but could find
nothing. She was quite worn out with weariness and hunger, and even
her staff was no further help to her, for in her many wanderings it had
become quite blunted. She almost gave up in despair, but made one last
great effort, and suddenly in a thicket she came upon the sort of house
that the mother of the Wind had described. It had no windows, and the
door was up in the roof. Round the house she went, in search of steps,
but could find none. What was she to do? How was she to get in? She
thought and thought, and tried in vain to climb up to the door. Then
suddenly she be-thought her of the chicken bones that she had dragged
all that weary way, and she said to herself: 'They would not all have
told me to take such good care of these bones if they had not had some
good reason for doing so. Perhaps now, in my hour of need, they may be
of use to me.'

So she took the bones out of her bundle, and having thought for a
moment, she placed the two ends together. To her surprise they stuck
tight; then she added the other bones, till she had two long poles the
height of the house; these she placed against the wall, at a distance of
a yard from one another. Across them she placed the other bones, piece
by piece, like the steps of a ladder. As soon as one step was finished
she stood upon it and made the next one, and then the next, till she
was close to the door. But just as she got near the top she noticed that
there were no bones left for the last rung of the ladder. What was she
to do? Without that last step the whole ladder was useless. She must
have lost one of the bones. Then suddenly an idea came to her. Taking
a knife she chopped off her little finger, and placing it on the last
step, it stuck as the bones had done. The ladder was complete, and with
her child on her arm she entered the door of the house. Here she found
everything in perfect order. Having taken some food, she laid the child
down to sleep in a trough that was on the floor, and sat down herself to
rest.

When her husband, the Pig, came back to his house, he was startled by
what he saw. At first he could not believe his eyes, and stared at the
ladder of bones, and at the little finger on the top of it. He felt that
some fresh magic must be at work, and in his terror he almost turned
away from the house; but then a better idea came to him, and he changed
himself into a dove, so that no witchcraft could have power over him,
and flew into the room without touching the ladder. Here he found a
woman rocking a child. At the sight of her, looking so changed by all
that she had suffered for his sake, his heart was moved by such love and
longing and by so great a pity that he suddenly became a man.

The Princess stood up when she saw him, and her heart beat with fear,
for she did not know him. But when he had told her who he was, in her
great joy she forgot all her sufferings, and they seemed as nothing to
her. He was a very handsome man, as straight as a fir tree. They sat
down together and she told him all her adventures, and he wept with pity
at the tale. And then he told her his own history.

'I am a King's son. Once when my father was fighting against some
dragons, who were the scourge of our country, I slew the youngest
dragon. His mother, who was a witch, cast a spell over me and changed me
into a Pig. It was she who in the disguise of an old woman gave you the
thread to bind round my foot. So that instead of the three days that
had to run before the spell was broken, I was forced to remain a Pig
for three more years. Now that we have suffered for each other, and have
found each other again, let us forget the past.'

And in their joy they kissed one another.

Next morning they set out early to return to his father's kingdom. Great
was the rejoicing of all the people when they saw him and his wife; his
father and his mother embraced them both, and there was feasting in the
palace for three days and three nights.

Then they set out to see her father. The old King nearly went out of his
mind with joy at beholding his daughter again. When she had told him all
her adventures, he said to her:

'Did not I tell you that I was quite sure that that creature who wooed
and won you as his wife had not been born a Pig? You see, my child, how
wise you were in doing what I told you.'

And as the King was old and had no heirs, he put them on the throne
in his place. And they ruled as only kings rule who have suffered
many things. And if they are not dead they are still living and ruling
happily.(8)
