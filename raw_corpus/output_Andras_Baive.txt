Andras Baive

[From Lapplandische Marchen, J. C. Poestion.]


Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and
swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near
him if they were running races in the summer evenings. The people of
Vadso were very proud of their champion, and thought that there was no
one like him in the world, till, by-and-by, it came to their ears that
there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp, Andras Baive by name, who was
said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff.
Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that, and declared that if it
made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense, why, let them!

The winter was long and cold, and the thoughts of the villagers were
much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive, when suddenly, on a
frosty day, he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso. The
bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength, and at once
went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour.
As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay
upon the shore, and his face shone with pleasure. 'That is the very
thing,' laughed he, 'I will make him jump over that boat.' Andras was
quite ready to accept the challenge, and they soon settled the terms of
the wager. He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching
it with his heel was to be the winner, and would get a large sum of
money as the prize. So, followed by many of the villagers, the two men
walked down to the sea.

An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play,
and to hold the stakes, and Andras, as the stranger was told to jump
first. Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark
the starting place, he ran forward, with his head well thrown back, and
cleared the boat with a mighty bound. The lookers-on cheered him, and
indeed he well deserve it; but they waited anxiously all the same to
see what the bailiff would do. On he came, taller than Andras by several
inches, but heavier of build. He too sprang high and well, but as
he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat. Dead silence
reigned amidst the townsfolk, but Andras only laughed and said
carelessly:

'Just a little too short, bailiff; next time you must do better than
that.'

The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival's scornful words, and
answered quickly: 'Next time you will have something harder to do.' And
turning his back on his friends, he went sulkily home. Andras, putting
the money he had earned in his pocket, went home also.

The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a
great fiord to the west of Vadso. A boy who had met him hastened to tell
the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off; and the bailiff,
disguising himself as a Stalo, or ogre, called his son and his dog and
rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras.

Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands, thinking of the
new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day
of his lucky jump. He wandered on, his eyes fixed on the sands, so
that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock, while he
changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves.
A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself, and looking up he
beheld the mass of wreckage. 'Dear me! I may find some use for that,'
he said; and hastened down to the sea, waiting till he could lay hold
of some stray rope which might float towards him. Suddenly--he could not
have told why--a nameless fear seized upon him, and he fled away from
the shore as if for his life. As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe,
such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use; and there flashed
into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat: 'Next
time you will have something harder to do.' So it was no wreckage after
all that he had seen, but the bailiff himself.

It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain, where
the sun never set, and it was very difficult to get to sleep, Andras had
spent many hours in the study of magic, and this stood him in good stead
now. The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become
the feet of a reindeer, and in this guise he galloped like the wind
for several miles. Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his
enemy was doing. Nothing he could see, but to his ears the notes of a
pipe floated over the plain, and ever, as he listened, it drew nearer.

A cold shiver shook Andras, and this time he wished himself the feet of
a reindeer calf. For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at which
he begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast nor
bird can come near him. A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all things
living. Yes; but not so swift as a Stalo, as Andras found out when he
stopped to rest, and heard the pipe playing!

For a moment his heart sank, and he gave himself up for dead, till he
remembered that, not far off, were two little lakes joined together by
a short though very broad river. In the middle of the river lay a stone
that was always covered by water, except in dry seasons, and as the
winter rains had been very heavy, he felt quite sure that not even the
top of it could be seen. The next minute, if anyone had been looking
that way, he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speeding
northwards, and by-and-by giving a great spring, which landed him in the
midst of the stream. But, instead of sinking to the bottom, he paused a
second to steady himself, then gave a second spring which landed him on
the further shore. He next ran on to a little hill where he saw down
and began to neigh loudly, so that the Stalo might know exactly where he
was.

'Ah! There you are,' cried the Stalo, appearing on the opposite bank;
'for a moment I really thought I had lost you.'

'No such luck,' answered Andras, shaking his head sorrowfully. By this
time he had taken his own shape again.

'Well, but I don't see how I am to get to you,' said the Stalo, looking
up and down.

'Jump over, as I did,' answered Andras; 'it is quite easy.'

'But I could not jump this river; and I don't know how you did,' replied
the Stalo.

'I should be ashamed to say such things,' exclaimed Andras. 'Do you mean
to tell me that a jump, which the weakest Lapp boy would make nothing
of, is beyond your strength?'

The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words, just as Andras
meant him to do. He bounded into the air and fell straight into the
river. Not that that would have mattered, for he was a good swimmer; but
Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries, and took
aim at him. His aim was good, but the Stalo sprang so high into the air
that the arrow flew between his feet. A second shot, directed at his
forehead, fared no better, for this time the Stalo jumped so high to
the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb. Then
Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo's head, and when he
sprang up, just an instant too soon, it hit him between the ribs.

Mortally wounded as he was, the Stalo was not yet dead, and managed to
swim to the shore. Stretching himself on the sand, he said slowly to
Andras:

'Promise that you will give me an honourable burial, and when my body is
laid in the grave go in my boat across the fiord, and take whatever you
find in my house which belongs to me. My dog you must kill, but spare my
son, Andras.'

Then he died; and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord and
found the dog and boy. The dog, a fierce, wicked-looking creature, he
slew with one blow from his fist, for it is well known that if a Stalo's
dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master's wounds the Stalo
comes to life again. That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seen without his
dog; but the bailiff, being only half a Stalo, had forgotten him, when
he went to the little lakes in search of Andras. Next, Andras put all
the gold and jewels which he found in the boat into his pockets, and
bidding the boy get in, pushed it off from the shore, leaving the little
craft to drift as it would, while he himself ran home. With the treasure
he possessed he was able to buy a great herd of reindeer; and he soon
married a rich wife, whose parents would not have him as a son-in-law
when he was poor, and the two lived happy for ever after.
