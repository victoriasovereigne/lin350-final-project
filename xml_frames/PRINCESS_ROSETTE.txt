ONCE upon a time there lived a King and Queen who had two beautiful sons and one little daughter, who was so pretty that no one who saw her could help loving her.
When it was time for the christening of the Princess, the Queen--as she always did--sent for all the fairies to be present at the ceremony, and afterwards invited them to a splendid banquet.
When it was over, and they were preparing to go away, the Queen said to them:  'Do not forget your usual good custom.
Tell me what is going to happen to Rosette.'
For that was the name they had given the Princess.
But the fairies said they had left their book of magic at home, and they would come another day and tell her.
'Ah!'
said the Queen, 'I know very well what that means--you have nothing good to say; but at least I beg that you will not hide anything from me.'
So, after a great deal of persuasion, they said:  'Madam, we fear that Rosette may be the cause of great misfortunes to her brothers; they may even meet with their death through her; that is all we have been able to foresee about your dear little daughter.
We are very sorry to have nothing better to tell you.'
Then they went away, leaving the Queen very sad, so sad that the King noticed it, and asked her what was the matter.
The Queen said that she had been sitting too near the fire, and had burnt all the flax that was upon her distaff.
'Oh!
is that all?'
said the King, and he went up into the garret and brought her down more flax than she could spin in a hundred years.
But the Queen still looked sad, and the King asked her again what was the matter.
She answered that she had been walking by the river and had dropped one of her green satin slippers into the water.
'Oh!
if that's all,' said the King, and he sent to all the shoe-makers in his kingdom, and they very soon made the Queen ten thousand green satin slippers, but still she looked sad.
So the King asked her again what was the matter, and this time she answered that in eating her porridge too hastily she had swallowed her wedding-ring.
But it so happened that the King knew better, for he had the ring himself, and he said:  'Oh I you are not telling me the truth, for I have your ring here in my purse.'
Then the Queen was very much ashamed, and she saw that the King was vexed with her; so she told him all that the fairies had predicted about Rosette, and begged him to think how the misfortunes might be prevented.
Then it was the King's turn to look sad, and at last he said:  'I see no way of saving our sons except by having Rosette's head cut off while she is still little.'
But the Queen cried that she would far rather have her own head cut off, and that he had better think of something else, for she would never consent to such a thing.
So they thought and thought, but they could not tell what to do, until at last the Queen heard that in a great forest near the castle there was an old hermit, who lived in a hollow tree, and that people came from far and near to consult him; so she said:  'I had better go and ask his advice; perhaps he will know what to do to prevent the misfortunes which the fairies foretold.'
She set out very early the next morning, mounted upon a pretty little white mule, which was shod with solid gold, and two of her ladies rode behind her on beautiful horses.
When they reached the forest they dismounted, for the trees grew so thickly that the horses could not pass, and made their way on foot to the hollow tree where the hermit lived.
At first when he saw them coming he was vexed, for he was not fond of ladies; but when he recognised the Queen, he said:  'You are welcome, Queen.
What do you come to ask of me?'
Then the Queen told him all the fairies had foreseen for Rosette, and asked what she should do, and the hermit answered that she must shut the Princess up in a tower and never let her come out of it again.
The Queen thanked and rewarded him, and hastened back to the castle to tell the King.
When he heard the news he had a great tower built as quickly as possible, and there the Princess was shut up, and the King and Queen and her two brothers went to see her every day that she might not be dull.
The eldest brother was called 'the Great Prince,' and the second 'the Little Prince.'
They loved their sister dearly, for she was the sweetest, prettiest princess who was ever seen, and the least little smile from her was worth more than a hundred pieces of gold.
When Rosette was fifteen years old the Great Prince went to the King and asked if it would not soon be time for her to be married, and the Little Prince put the same question to the Queen.
Their majesties were amused at them for thinking of it, but did not make any reply, and soon after both the King and the Queen were taken ill, and died on the same day.
Everybody was sorry, Rosette especially, and all the bells in the kingdom were tolled.
Then all the dukes and counsellors put the Great Prince upon a golden throne, and crowned him with a diamond crown, and they all cried, 'Long live the King!'
And after that there was nothing but feasting and rejoicing.
The new King and his brother said to one another:  'Now that we are the masters, let us take our sister out of that dull tower which she is so tired of.'
They had only to go across the garden to reach the tower, which was very high, and stood up in a corner.
Rosette was busy at her embroidery, but when she saw her brothers she got up, and taking the King's hand cried:  'Good morning, dear brother.
Now that you are King, please take me out of this dull tower, for I am so tired of it.'
Then she began to cry, but the King kissed her and told her to dry her tears, as that was just what they had come for, to take her out of the tower and bring her to their beautiful castle, and the Prince showed her the pocketful of sugar plums he had brought for her, and said:  'Make haste, and let us get away from this ugly tower, and very soon the King will arrange a grand marriage for you.'
When Rosette saw the beautiful garden, full of fruit and flowers, with green grass and sparkling fountains, she was so astonished that not a word could she say, for she had never in her life seen anything like it before.
She looked about her, and ran hither and thither gathering fruit and flowers, and her little dog Frisk, who was bright green all over, and had but one ear, danced before her, crying 'Bow-wow-wow,' and turning head over heels in the most enchanting way.
Everybody was amused at Frisk's antics, but all of a sudden he ran away into a little wood, and the Princess was following him, when, to her great delight, she saw a peacock, who was spreading his tail in the sunshine.
Rosette thought she had never seen anything so pretty.
She could not take her eyes off him, and there she stood entranced until the King and the Prince came up and asked what was amusing her so much.
She showed them the peacock, and asked what it was, and they answered that it was a bird which people sometimes ate.
'What!'
said the Princess, 'do they dare to kill that beautiful creature and eat it?
I declare that I will never marry any one but the King of the Peacocks, and when I am Queen I will take very good care that nobody eats any of my subjects.'
At this the King was very much astonished.
'But, little sister,' said he, 'where shall we find the King of the Peacocks?'
'Oh!
wherever you like, sire,' she answered, 'but I will never marry any one else.'
After this they took Rosette to the beautiful castle, and the peacock was brought with her, and told to walk about on the terrace outside her windows, so that she might always see him, and then the ladies of the court came to see the Princess, and they brought her beautiful presents--dresses and ribbons and sweetmeats, diamonds and pearls and dolls and embroidered slippers, and she was so well brought up, and said, 'Thank you!'
so prettily, and was so gracious, that everyone went away delighted with her.
Meanwhile the King and the Prince were considering how they should find the King of the Peacocks, if there was such a person in the world.
And first of all they had a portrait made of the Princess, which was so like her that you really would not have been surprised if it had spoken to you.
Then they said to her:  'Since you will not marry anyone but the King of the Peacocks, we are going out together into the wide world to search for him.
If we find him for you we shall be very glad.
In the meantime, mind you take good care of our kingdom.'
Rosette thanked them for all the trouble they were taking on her account, and promised to take great care of the kingdom, and only to amuse herself by looking at the peacock, and making Frisk dance while they were away.
So they set out, and asked everyone they met--  'Do you know the King of the Peacocks?'
But the answer was always, 'No, no.'
Then they went on and on, so far that no one has ever been farther, and at last they came to the Kingdom of the Cockchafers.
They had never before seen such a number of cockchafers, and the buzzing was so loud that the King was afraid he should be deafened by it.
He asked the most distinguished-looking cockchafer they met if he knew where they could find the King of the Peacocks.
'Sire,' replied the cockchafer, 'his kingdom is thirty thousand leagues from this; you have come the longest way.'
'And how do you know that?'
said the King.
'Oh!'
said the cockchafer, 'we all know you very well, since we spend two or three months in your garden every year.'
Thereupon the King and the Prince made great friends with him, and they all walked arm-in-arm and dined together, and afterwards the cockchafer showed them all the curiosities of his strange country, where the tiniest green leaf costs a gold piece and more.
Then they set out again to finish their journey, and this time, as they knew the way, they were not long upon the road.
It was easy to guess that they had come to the right place, for they saw peacocks in every tree, and their cries could be heard a long way off:  When they reached the city they found it full of men and women who were dressed entirely in peacocks' feathers, which were evidently thought prettier than anything else.
They soon met the King, who was driving about in a beautiful little golden carriage which glittered with diamonds, and was drawn at full speed by twelve peacocks.
The King and the Prince were delighted to see that the King of the Peacocks was as handsome as possible.
He had curly golden hair and was very pale, and he wore a crown of peacocks' feathers.
When he saw Rosette's brothers he knew at once that they were strangers, and stopping his carriage he sent for them to speak to him.
When they had greeted him they said:  'Sire, we have come from very far away to show you a beautiful portrait.'
So saying they drew from their travelling bag the picture of Rosette.
The King looked at it in silence a long time, but at last he said:  'I could not have believed that there was such a beautiful Princess in the world!'
'Indeed, she is really a hundred times as pretty as that,' said her brothers.
'I think you must be making fun of me,' replied the King of the Peacocks.
'Sire,' said the Prince, 'my brother is a King, like yourself.
He is called "the King," I am called "the Prince," and that is the portrait of our sister, the Princess Rosette.
We have come to ask if you would like to marry her.
She is as good as she is beautiful, and we will give her a bushel of gold pieces for her dowry.'
'Oh!
with all my heart,' replied the King, 'and I will make her very happy.
She shall have whatever she likes, and I shall love her dearly; only I warn you that if she is not as pretty as you have told me, I will have your heads cut off.'
'Oh!
certainly, we quite agree to that,' said the brothers in one breath.
'Very well.
Off with you into prison, and stay there until the Princess arrives,' said the King of the Peacocks.
And the Princes were so sure that Rosette was far prettier than her portrait that they went without a murmur.
They were very kindly treated, and that they might not feel dull the King came often to see them.
As for Rosette's portrait that was taken up to the palace, and the King did nothing but gaze at it all day and all night.
As the King and the Prince had to stay in prison, they sent a letter to the Princess telling her to pack up all her treasures as quickly as possible, and come to them, as the King of the Peacocks was waiting to marry her; but they did not say that they were in prison, for fear of making her uneasy.
When Rosette received the letter she was so delighted that she ran about telling everyone that the King of the Peacocks was found, and she was going to marry him.
Guns were fired, and fireworks let off.
Everyone had as many cakes and sweetmeats as he wanted.
And for three days everybody who came to see the Princess was presented with a slice of bread-and-jam, a nightingale's egg, and some hippocras.
After having thus entertained her friends, she distributed her dolls among them, and left her brother's kingdom to the care of the wisest old men of the city, telling them to take charge of everything, not to spend any money, but save it all up until the King should return, and above all, not to forget to feed her peacock.
Then she set out, only taking with her her nurse, and the nurse's daughter, and the little green dog Frisk.
They took a boat and put out to sea, carrying with them the bushel of gold pieces, and enough dresses to last the Princess ten years if she wore two every day, and they did nothing but laugh and sing.
The nurse asked the boatman:  'Can you take us, can you take us to the kingdom of the peacocks?'
But he answered:  'Oh no!
oh no!'
Then she said:  'You must take us, you must take us.'
And he answered:  'Very soon, very soon.'
Then the nurse said:  'Will you take us?
will you take us?'
And the boatman answered:  'Yes, yes.'
Then she whispered in his ear:  'Do you want to make your fortune?'
And he said:  'Certainly I do.'
'I can tell you how to get a bag of gold,' said she.
'I ask nothing better,' said the boatman.
'Well,' said the nurse, 'to-night, when the Princess is asleep, you must help me to throw her into the sea, and when she is drowned I will put her beautiful clothes upon my daughter, and we will take her to the King of the Peacocks, who will be only too glad to marry her, and as your reward you shall have your boat full of diamonds.'
The boatman was very much surprised at this proposal, and said:  'But what a pity to drown such a pretty Princess!'
However, at last the nurse persuaded him to help her, and when the night came and the Princess was fast asleep as usual, with Frisk curled up on his own cushion at the foot of her bed, the wicked nurse fetched the boatman and her daughter, and between them they picked up the Princess, feather bed, mattress, pillows, blankets and all, and threw her into the sea, without even waking her.
Now, luckily, the Princess's bed was entirely stuffed with phoenix feathers, which are very rare, and have the property of always floating upon water, so Rosette went on swimming about as if she had been in a boat.
After a little while she began to feel very cold, and turned round so often that she woke Frisk, who started up, and, having a very good nose, smelt the soles and herrings so close to him that he began to bark.
He barked so long and so loud that he woke all the other fish, who came swimming up round the Princess's bed, and poking at it with their great heads.
As for her, she said to herself:  'How our boat does rock upon the water!
I am really glad that I am not often as uncomfortable as I have been to-night.'
The wicked nurse and the boatman, who were by this time quite a long way off, heard Frisk barking, and said to each other:  'That horrid little animal and his mistress are drinking our health in sea-water now.
Let us make haste to land, for we must be quite near the city of the King of the Peacocks.'
The King had sent a hundred carriages to meet them, drawn by every kind of strange animal.
There were lions, bears, wolves, stags, horses, buffaloes, eagles, and peacocks.
The carriage intended for the Princess Rosette had six blue monkeys, which could turn summer-saults, and dance on a tight-rope, and do many other charming tricks.
Their harness was all of crimson velvet with gold buckles, and behind the carriage walked sixty beautiful ladies chosen by the King to wait upon Rosette and amuse her.
The nurse had taken all the pains imaginable to deck out her daughter.
She put on her Rosette's prettiest frock, and covered her with diamonds from head to foot.
But she was so ugly that nothing could make her look nice, and what was worse, she was sulky and ill-tempered, and did nothing but grumble all the time.
When she stepped from the boat and the escort sent by the King of the Peacocks caught sight of her, they were so surprised that they could not say a single word.
'Now then, look alive,' cried the false Princess.
'If you don't bring me something to eat I will have all your heads cut off!'
Then they whispered one to another:  'Here's a pretty state of things!
she is as wicked as she is ugly.
What a bride for our poor King!
She certainly was not worth bringing from the other end of the world!'
But she went on ordering them all about, and for no fault at all would give slaps and pinches to everyone she could reach.
As the procession was so long it advanced but slowly, and the nurse's daughter sat up in her carriage trying to look like a Queen.
But the peacocks, who were sitting upon every tree waiting to salute her, and who had made up their minds to cry, 'Long live our beautiful Queen!'
when they caught sight of the false bride could not help crying instead:  'Oh!
how ugly she is!'
Which offended her so much that she said to the guards:  'Make haste and kill all these insolent peacocks who have dared to insult me.'
But the peacocks only flew away, laughing at her.
The rogue of a boatman, who noticed all this, said softly to the nurse:  'This is a bad business for us, gossip; your daughter ought to have been prettier.'
But she answered:  'Be quiet, stupid, or you will spoil everything.'
Now they told the King that the Princess was approaching.
'Well,' said he, 'did her brothers tell me truly?
Is she prettier than her portrait?'
'Sire,' they answered, 'if she were as pretty that would do very well.'
'That's true,' said the King; 'I for one shall be quite satisfied if she is.
Let us go and meet her.'
For they knew by the uproar that she had arrived, but they could not tell what all the shouting was about.
The King thought he could hear the words:  'How ugly she is!
How ugly she is!'
and he fancied they must refer to some dwarf the Princess was bringing with her.
It never occurred to him that they could apply to the bride herself.
The Princess Rosette's portrait was carried at the head of the procession, and after it walked the King surrounded by his courtiers.
He was all impatience to see the lovely Princess, but when he caught sight of the nurse's daughter he was furiously angry, and would not advance another step.
For she was really ugly enough to have frightened anybody.
'What!'
he cried, 'have the two rascals who are my prisoners dared to play me such a trick as this?
Do they propose that I shall marry this hideous creature?
Let her be shut up in my great tower, with her nurse and those who brought her here; and as for them, I will have their heads cut off.'
Meanwhile the King and the Prince, who knew that their sister must have arrived, had made themselves smart, and sat expecting every minute to be summoned to greet her.
So when the gaoler came with soldiers, and carried them down into a black dungeon which swarmed with toads and bats, and where they were up to their necks in water, nobody could have been more surprised and dismayed than they were.
'This is a dismal kind of wedding,' they said; 'what can have happened that we should be treated like this?
They must mean to kill us.'
And this idea annoyed them very much.
Three days passed before they heard any news, and then the King of the Peacocks came and berated them through a hole in the wall.
'You have called yourselves King and Prince,' he cried, 'to try and make me marry your sister, but you are nothing but beggars, not worth the water you drink.
I mean to make short work with you, and the sword is being sharpened that will cut off your heads!'
'King of the Peacocks,' answered the King angrily, 'you had better take care what you are about.
I am as good a King as yourself, and have a splendid kingdom and robes and crowns, and plenty of good red gold to do what I like with.
You are pleased to jest about having our heads cut off; perhaps you think we have stolen something from you?'
At first the King of the Peacocks was taken aback by this bold speech, and had half a mind to send them all away together; but his Prime Minister declared that it would never do to let such a trick as that pass unpunished, everybody would laugh at him; so the accusation was drawn up against them, that they were impostors, and that they had promised the King a beautiful Princess in marriage who, when she arrived, proved to be an ugly peasant girl.
This accusation was read to the prisoners, who cried out that they had spoken the truth, that their sister was indeed a Princess more beautiful than the day, and that there was some mystery about all this which they could not fathom.
Therefore they demanded seven days in which to prove their innocence, The King of the Peacocks was so angry that he would hardly even grant them this favour, but at last he was persuaded to do so.
While all this was going on at court, let us see what had been happening to the real Princess.
When the day broke she and Frisk were equally astonished at finding themselves alone upon the sea, with no boat and no one to help them.
The Princess cried and cried, until even the fishes were sorry for her.
'Alas!'
she said, 'the King of the Peacocks must have ordered me to be thrown into the sea because he had changed his mind and did not want to marry me.
But how strange of him, when I should have loved him so much, and we should have been so happy together!'
And then she cried harder than ever, for she could not help still loving him.
So for two days they floated up and down the sea, wet and shivering with the cold, and so hungry that when the Princess saw some oysters she caught them, and she and Frisk both ate some, though they didn't like them at all.
When night came the Princess was so frightened that she said to Frisk:  'Oh!
Do please keep on barking for fear the soles should come and eat us up!'
Now it happened that they had floated close in to the shore, where a poor old man lived all alone in a little cottage.
When he heard Frisk's barking he thought to himself:  'There must have been a shipwreck!'
(for no dogs ever passed that way by any chance), and he went out to see if he could be of any use.
He soon saw the Princess and Frisk floating up and down, and Rosette, stretching out her hands to him, cried:  'Oh!
Good old man, do save me, or I shall die of cold and hunger!'
When he heard her cry out so piteously he was very sorry for her, and ran back into his house to fetch a long boat-hook.
Then he waded into the water up to his chin, and after being nearly drowned once or twice he at last succeeded in getting hold of the Princess's bed and dragging it on shore.
Rosette and Frisk were joyful enough to find themselves once more on dry land, and the Princess thanked the old man heartily; then, wrapping herself up in her blankets, she daintily picked her way up to the cottage on her little bare feet.
There the old man lighted a fire of straw, and then drew from an old box his wife's dress and shoes, which the Princess put on, and thus roughly clad looked as charming as possible, and Frisk danced his very best to amuse her.
The old man saw that Rosette must be some great lady, for her bed coverings were all of satin and gold.
He begged that she would tell him all her history, as she might safely trust him.
The Princess told him everything, weeping bitterly again at the thought that it was by the King's orders that she had been thrown overboard.
'And now, my daughter, what is to be done?'
said the old man.
'You are a great Princess, accustomed to fare daintily, and I have nothing to offer you but black bread and radishes, which will not suit you at all.
Shall I go and tell the King of the Peacocks that you are here?
If he sees you he will certainly wish to marry you.'
'Oh no!'
cried Rosette, 'he must be wicked, since he tried to drown me.
Don't let us tell him, but if you have a little basket give it to me.'
The old man gave her a basket, and tying it round Frisk's neck she said to him: 'Go and find out the best cooking-pot in the town and bring the contents to me.'
Away went Frisk, and as there was no better dinner cooking in all the town than the King's, he adroitly took the cover off the pot and brought all it contained to the Princess, who said:  'Now go back to the pantry, and bring the best of everything you find there.'
So Frisk went back and filled his basket with white bread, and red wine, and every kind of sweetmeat, until it was almost too heavy for him to carry.
When the King of the Peacocks wanted his dinner there was nothing in the pot and nothing in the pantry.
All the courtiers looked at one another in dismay, and the King was terribly cross.
'Oh well!
'he said, 'if there is no dinner I cannot dine, but take care that plenty of things are roasted for supper.'
When evening came the Princess said to Frisk:  'Go into the town and find out the best kitchen, and bring me all the nicest morsels that are being roasted upon the spit.'
Frisk did as he was told, and as he knew of no better kitchen than the King's, he went in softly, and when the cook's back was turned took everything that was upon the spit, As it happened it was all done to a turn, and looked so good that it made him hungry only to see it.
He carried his basket to the Princess, who at once sent him back to the pantry to bring all the tarts and sugar plums that had been prepared for the King's supper.
The King, as he had had no dinner, was very hungry and wanted his supper early, but when he asked for it, lo and behold it was all gone, and he had to go to bed half-starved and in a terrible temper.
The next day the same thing happened, and the next, so that for three days the King got nothing at all to eat, because just when the dinner or the supper was ready to be served it mysteriously disappeared.
At last the Prime Minister began to be afraid that the King would be starved to death, so he resolved to hide himself in some dark corner of the kitchen, and never take his eyes off the cooking-pot.
His surprise was great when he presently saw a little green dog with one ear slip softly into the kitchen, uncover the pot, transfer all its contents to his basket, and run off.
The Prime Minister followed hastily, and tracked him all through the town to the cottage of the good old man; then he ran back to the King and told him that he had found out where all his dinners and suppers went.
The King, who was very much astonished, said he should like to go and see for himself.
So he set out, accompanied by the Prime Minister and a guard of archers, and arrived just in time to find the old man and the Princess finishing his dinner.
The King ordered that they should be seized and bound with ropes, and Frisk also.
When they were brought back to the palace some one told the King, who said:  'To-day is the last day of the respite granted to those impostors; they shall have their heads cut off at the same time as these stealers of my dinner.'
Then the old man went down on his knees before the King and begged for time to tell him everything.
While he spoke the King for the first time looked attentively at the Princess, because he was sorry to see how she cried, and when he heard the old man saying that her name was Rosette, and that she had been treacherously thrown into the sea, he turned head over heels three times without stopping, in spite of being quite weak from hunger, and ran to embrace her, and untied the ropes which bound her with his own hands, declaring that he loved her with all his heart.
Messengers were sent to bring the Princes out of prison, and they came very sadly, believing that they were to be executed at once: the nurse and her daughter and the boatman were brought also.
As soon as they came in Rosette ran to embrace her brothers, while the traitors threw themselves down before her and begged for mercy.
The King and the Princess were so happy that they freely forgave them, and as for the good old man he was splendidly rewarded, and spent the rest of his days in the palace.
The King of the Peacocks made ample amends to the King and Prince for the way in which they had been treated, and did everything in his power to show how sorry he was.
The nurse restored to Rosette all her dresses and jewels, and the bushel of gold pieces; the wedding was held at once, and they all lived happily ever after--even to Frisk, who enjoyed the greatest luxury, and never had anything worse than the wing of a partridge for dinner all the rest of his life.
(7)  (7) Madame d'Aulnoy.
THE ENCHANTED PIG  ONCE upon a time there lived a King who had three daughters.
Now it happened that he had to go out to battle, so he called his daughters and said to them:  'My dear children, I am obliged to go to the wars.
The enemy is approaching us with a large army.
It is a great grief to me to leave you all.
During my absence take care of yourselves and be good girls; behave well and look after everything in the house.
You may walk in the garden, and you may go into all the rooms in the palace, except the room at the back in the right-hand corner; into that you must not enter, for harm would befall you.'
'You may keep your mind easy, father,' they replied.
'We have never been disobedient to you.
Go in peace, and may heaven give you a glorious victory!'
When everything was ready for his departure, the King gave them the keys of all the rooms and reminded them once more of what he had said.
His daughters kissed his hands with tears in their eyes, and wished him prosperity, and he gave the eldest the keys.
Now when the girls found themselves alone they felt so sad and dull that they did not know what to do.
So, to pass the time, they decided to work for part of the day, to read for part of the day, and to enjoy themselves in the garden for part of the day.
As long as they did this all went well with them.
But this happy state of things did not last long.
Every day they grew more and more curious, and you will see what the end of that was.
'Sisters,' said the eldest Princess, 'all day long we sew, spin, and read.
We have been several days quite alone, and there is no corner of the garden that we have not explored.
We have been in all the rooms of our father's palace, and have admired the rich and beautiful furniture: why should not we go into the room that our father forbad us to enter?'
Sister,' said the youngest, 'I cannot think how you can tempt us to break our father's command.
When he told us not to go into that room he must have known what he was saying, and have had a good reason for saying it.'
'Surely the sky won't fall about our heads if we DO go in,' said the second Princess.
'Dragons and such like monsters that would devour us will not be hidden in the room.
And how will our father ever find out that we have gone in?'
While they were speaking thus, encouraging each other, they had reached the room; the eldest fitted the key into the lock, and snap!
the door stood open.
The three girls entered, and what do you think they saw?
The room was quite empty, and without any ornament, but in the middle stood a large table, with a gorgeous cloth, and on it lay a big open book.
Now the Princesses were curious to know what was written in the book, especially the eldest, and this is what she read:  'The eldest daughter of this King will marry a prince from the East.'
Then the second girl stepped forward, and turning over the page she read:  'The second daughter of this King will marry a prince from the West.'
The girls were delighted, and laughed and teased each other.
But the youngest Princess did not want to go near the table or to open the book.
Her elder sisters however left her no peace, and will she, nill she, they dragged her up to the table, and in fear and trembling she turned over the page and read:  'The youngest daughter of this King will be married to a pig from the North.'
Now if a thunderbolt had fallen upon her from heaven it would not have frightened her more.
She almost died of misery, and if her sisters had not held her up, she would have sunk to the ground and cut her head open.
When she came out of the fainting fit into which she had fallen in her terror, her sisters tried to comfort her, saying:  'How can you believe such nonsense?
When did it ever happen that a king's daughter married a pig?'
'What a baby you are!'
said the other sister; 'has not our father enough soldiers to protect you, even if the disgusting creature did come to woo you?'
The youngest Princess would fain have let herself be convinced by her sisters' words, and have believed what they said, but her heart was heavy.
Her thoughts kept turning to the book, in which stood written that great happiness waited her sisters, but that a fate was in store for her such as had never before been known in the world.
Besides, the thought weighed on her heart that she had been guilty of disobeying her father.
She began to get quite ill, and in a few days she was so changed that it was difficult to recognise her; formerly she had been rosy and merry, now she was pale and nothing gave her any pleasure.
She gave up playing with her sisters in the garden, ceased to gather flowers to put in her hair, and never sang when they sat together at their spinning and sewing.
In the meantime the King won a great victory, and having completely defeated and driven off the enemy, he hurried home to his daughters, to whom his thoughts had constantly turned.
Everyone went out to meet him with cymbals and fifes and drums, and there was great rejoicing over his victorious return.
The King's first act on reaching home was to thank Heaven for the victory he had gained over the enemies who had risen against him.
He then entered his palace, and the three Princesses stepped forward to meet him.
His joy was great when he saw that they were all well, for the youngest did her best not to appear sad.
In spite of this, however, it was not long before the King noticed that his third daughter was getting very thin and sad-looking.
And all of a sudden he felt as if a hot iron were entering his soul, for it flashed through his mind that she had disobeyed his word.
He felt sure he was right; but to be quite certain he called his daughters to him, questioned them, and ordered them to speak the truth.
They confessed everything, but took good care not to say which had led the other two into temptation.
The King was so distressed when he heard it that he was almost overcome by grief.
But he took heart and tried to comfort his daughters, who looked frightened to death.
He saw that what had happened had happened, and that a thousand words would not alter matters by a hair's-breadth.
Well, these events had almost been forgotten when one fine day a prince from the East appeared at the Court and asked the King for the hand of his eldest daughter.
The King gladly gave his consent.
A great wedding banquet was prepared, and after three days of feasting the happy pair were accompanied to the frontier with much ceremony and rejoicing.
After some time the same thing befell the second daughter, who was wooed and won by a prince from the West.
Now when the young Princess saw that everything fell out exactly as had been written in the book, she grew very sad.
She refused to eat, and would not put on her fine clothes nor go out walking, and declared that she would rather die than become a laughing-stock to the world.
But the King would not allow her to do anything so wrong, and he comforted her in all possible ways.
So the time passed, till lo and behold!
one fine day an enormous pig from the North walked into the palace, and going straight up to the King said, 'Hail!
oh King.
May your life be as prosperous and bright as sunrise on a clear day!'
'I am glad to see you well, friend,' answered the King, 'but what wind has brought you hither?'
'I come a-wooing,' replied the Pig.
Now the King was astonished to hear so fine a speech from a Pig, and at once it occurred to him that something strange was the matter.
He would gladly have turned the Pig's thoughts in another direction, as he did not wish to give him the Princess for a wife; but when he heard that the Court and the whole street were full of all the pigs in the world he saw that there was no escape, and that he must give his consent.
The Pig was not satisfied with mere promises, but insisted that the wedding should take place within a week, and would not go away till the King had sworn a royal oath upon it.
The King then sent for his daughter, and advised her to submit to fate, as there was nothing else to be done.
And he added:  'My child, the words and whole behaviour of this Pig are quite unlike those of other pigs.
I do not myself believe that he always was a pig.
Depend upon it some magic or witchcraft has been at work.
Obey him, and do everything that he wishes, and I feel sure that Heaven will shortly send you release.'
'If you wish me to do this, dear father, I will do it,' replied the girl.
In the meantime the wedding-day drew near.
After the marriage, the Pig and his bride set out for his home in one of the royal carriages.
On the way they passed a great bog, and the Pig ordered the carriage to stop, and got out and rolled about in the mire till he was covered with mud from head to foot; then he got back into the carriage and told his wife to kiss him.
What was the poor girl to do?
She bethought herself of her father's words, and, pulling out her pocket handkerchief, she gently wiped the Pig's snout and kissed it.
By the time they reached the Pig's dwelling, which stood in a thick wood, it was quite dark.
They sat down quietly for a little, as they were tired after their drive; then they had supper together, and lay down to rest.
During the night the Princess noticed that the Pig had changed into a man.
She was not a little surprised, but remembering her father's words, she took courage, determined to wait and see what would happen.
And now she noticed that every night the Pig became a man, and every morning he was changed into a Pig before she awoke.
This happened several nights running, and the Princess could not understand it at all.
Clearly her husband must be bewitched.
In time she grew quite fond of him, he was so kind and gentle.
One fine day as she was sitting alone she saw an old witch go past.
She felt quite excited, as it was so long since she had seen a human being, and she called out to the old woman to come and talk to her.
Among other things the witch told her that she understood all magic arts, and that she could foretell the future, and knew the healing powers of herbs and plants.
'I shall be grateful to you all my life, old dame,' said the Princess, 'if you will tell me what is the matter with my husband.
Why is he a Pig by day and a human being by night?'
'I was just going to tell you that one thing, my dear, to show you what a good fortune-teller I am.
If you like, I will give you a herb to break the spell.'
'If you will only give it to me,' said the Princess, 'I will give you anything you choose to ask for, for I cannot bear to see him in this state.'
'Here, then, my dear child,' said the witch, 'take this thread, but do not let him know about it, for if he did it would lose its healing power.
At night, when he is asleep, you must get up very quietly, and fasten the thread round his left foot as firmly as possible; and you will see in the morning he will not have changed back into a Pig, but will still be a man.
I do not want any reward.
I shall be sufficiently repaid by knowing that you are happy.
It almost breaks my heart to think of all you have suffered, and I only wish I had known it sooner, as I should have come to your rescue at once.'
When the old witch had gone away the Princess hid the thread very carefully, and at night she got up quietly, and with a beating heart she bound the thread round her husband's foot.
Just as she was pulling the knot tight there was a crack, and the thread broke, for it was rotten.
Her husband awoke with a start, and said to her, 'Unhappy woman, what have you done?
Three days more and this unholy spell would have fallen from me, and now, who knows how long I may have to go about in this disgusting shape?
I must leave you at once, and we shall not meet again until you have worn out three pairs of iron shoes and blunted a steel staff in your search for me.'
So saying he disappeared.
Now, when the Princess was left alone she began to weep and moan in a way that was pitiful to hear; but when she saw that her tears and groans did her no good, she got up, determined to go wherever fate should lead her.
On reaching a town, the first thing she did was to order three pairs of iron sandals and a steel staff, and having made these preparations for her journey, she set out in search of her husband.
On and on she wandered over nine seas and across nine continents; through forests with trees whose stems were as thick as beer-barrels; stumbling and knocking herself against the fallen branches, then picking herself up and going on; the boughs of the trees hit her face, and the shrubs tore her hands, but on she went, and never looked back.
At last, wearied with her long journey and worn out and overcome with sorrow, but still with hope at her heart, she reached a house.
Now who do you think lived there?
The Moon.
The Princess knocked at the door, and begged to be let in that she might rest a little.
The mother of the Moon, when she saw her sad plight, felt a great pity for her, and took her in and nursed and tended her.
And while she was here the Princess had a little baby.
One day the mother of the Moon asked her:  'How was it possible for you, a mortal, to get hither to the house of the Moon?'
Then the poor Princess told her all that happened to her, and added 'I shall always be thankful to Heaven for leading me hither, and grateful to you that you took pity on me and on my baby, and did not leave us to die.
Now I beg one last favour of you; can your daughter, the Moon, tell me where my husband is?'
'She cannot tell you that, my child,' replied the goddess, 'but, if you will travel towards the East until you reach the dwelling of the Sun, he may be able to tell you something.'
Then she gave the Princess a roast chicken to eat, and warned her to be very careful not to lose any of the bones, because they might be of great use to her.
When the Princess had thanked her once more for her hospitality and for her good advice, and had thrown away one pair of shoes that were worn out, and had put on a second pair, she tied up the chicken bones in a bundle, and taking her baby in her arms and her staff in her hand, she set out once more on her wanderings.
On and on and on she went across bare sandy deserts, where the roads were so heavy that for every two steps that she took forwards she fell back one; but she struggled on till she had passed these dreary plains; next she crossed high rocky mountains, jumping from crag to crag and from peak to peak.
Sometimes she would rest for a little on a mountain, and then start afresh always farther and farther on.
She had to cross swamps and to scale mountain peaks covered with flints, so that her feet and knees and elbows were all torn and bleeding, and sometimes she came to a precipice across which she could not jump, and she had to crawl round on hands and knees, helping herself along with her staff.
At length, wearied to death, she reached the palace in which the Sun lived.
She knocked and begged for admission.
The mother of the Sun opened the door, and was astonished at beholding a mortal from the distant earthly shores, and wept with pity when she heard of all she had suffered.
Then, having promised to ask her son about the Princess's husband, she hid her in the cellar, so that the Sun might notice nothing on his return home, for he was always in a bad temper when he came in at night.
The next day the Princess feared that things would not go well with her, for the Sun had noticed that some one from the other world had been in the palace.
But his mother had soothed him with soft words, assuring him that this was not so.
So the Princess took heart when she saw how kindly she was treated, and asked:  'But how in the world is it possible for the Sun to be angry?
He is so beautiful and so good to mortals.'
'This is how it happens,' replied the Sun's mother.
'In the morning when he stands at the gates of paradise he is happy, and smiles on the whole world, but during the day he gets cross, because he sees all the evil deeds of men, and that is why his heat becomes so scorching; but in the evening he is both sad and angry, for he stands at the gates of death; that is his usual course.
From there he comes back here.'
She then told the Princess that she had asked about her hus-band, but that her son had replied that he knew nothing about him, and that her only hope was to go and inquire of the Wind.
Before the Princess left the mother of the Sun gave her a roast chicken to eat, and advised her to take great care of the bones, which she did, wrapping them up in a bundle.
She then threw away her second pair of shoes, which were quite worn out, and with her child on her arm and her staff in her hand, she set forth on her way to the Wind.
In these wanderings she met with even greater difficulties than before, for she came upon one mountain of flints after another, out of which tongues of fire would flame up; she passed through woods which had never been trodden by human foot, and had to cross fields of ice and avalanches of snow.
The poor woman nearly died of these hardships, but she kept a brave heart, and at length she reached an enormous cave in the side of a mountain.
This was where the Wind lived.
There was a little door in the railing in front of the cave, and here the Princess knocked and begged for admission.
The mother of the Wind had pity on her and took her in, that she might rest a little.
Here too she was hidden away, so that the Wind might not notice her.
The next morning the mother of the Wind told her that her husband was living in a thick wood, so thick that no axe had been able to cut a way through it; here he had built himself a sort of house by placing trunks of trees together and fastening them with withes and here he lived alone, shunning human kind.
After the mother of the Wind had given the Princess a chicken to eat, and had warned her to take care of the bones, she advised her to go by the Milky Way, which at night lies across the sky, and to wander on till she reached her goal.
Having thanked the old woman with tears in her eyes for her hospitality, and for the good news she had given her, the Princess set out on her journey and rested neither night nor day, so great was her longing to see her husband again.
On and on she walked until her last pair of shoes fell in pieces.
So she threw them away and went on with bare feet, not heeding the bogs nor the thorns that wounded her, nor the stones that bruised her.
At last she reached a beautiful green meadow on the edge of a wood.
Her heart was cheered by the sight of the flowers and the soft cool grass, and she sat down and rested for a little.
But hearing the birds chirping to their mates among the trees made her think with longing of her husband, and she wept bitterly, and taking her child in her arms, and her bundle of chicken bones on her shoulder, she entered the wood.
For three days and three nights she struggled through it, but could find nothing.
She was quite worn out with weariness and hunger, and even her staff was no further help to her, for in her many wanderings it had become quite blunted.
She almost gave up in despair, but made one last great effort, and suddenly in a thicket she came upon the sort of house that the mother of the Wind had described.
It had no windows, and the door was up in the roof.
Round the house she went, in search of steps, but could find none.
What was she to do?
How was she to get in?
She thought and thought, and tried in vain to climb up to the door.
Then suddenly she be-thought her of the chicken bones that she had dragged all that weary way, and she said to herself: 'They would not all have told me to take such good care of these bones if they had not had some good reason for doing so.
Perhaps now, in my hour of need, they may be of use to me.'
So she took the bones out of her bundle, and having thought for a moment, she placed the two ends together.
To her surprise they stuck tight; then she added the other bones, till she had two long poles the height of the house; these she placed against the wall, at a distance of a yard from one another.
Across them she placed the other bones, piece by piece, like the steps of a ladder.
As soon as one step was finished she stood upon it and made the next one, and then the next, till she was close to the door.
But just as she got near the top she noticed that there were no bones left for the last rung of the ladder.
What was she to do?
Without that last step the whole ladder was useless.
She must have lost one of the bones.
Then suddenly an idea came to her.
Taking a knife she chopped off her little finger, and placing it on the last step, it stuck as the bones had done.
The ladder was complete, and with her child on her arm she entered the door of the house.
Here she found everything in perfect order.
Having taken some food, she laid the child down to sleep in a trough that was on the floor, and sat down herself to rest.
When her husband, the Pig, came back to his house, he was startled by what he saw.
At first he could not believe his eyes, and stared at the ladder of bones, and at the little finger on the top of it.
He felt that some fresh magic must be at work, and in his terror he almost turned away from the house; but then a better idea came to him, and he changed himself into a dove, so that no witchcraft could have power over him, and flew into the room without touching the ladder.
Here he found a woman rocking a child.
At the sight of her, looking so changed by all that she had suffered for his sake, his heart was moved by such love and longing and by so great a pity that he suddenly became a man.
The Princess stood up when she saw him, and her heart beat with fear, for she did not know him.
But when he had told her who he was, in her great joy she forgot all her sufferings, and they seemed as nothing to her.
He was a very handsome man, as straight as a fir tree.
They sat down together and she told him all her adventures, and he wept with pity at the tale.
And then he told her his own history.
'I am a King's son.
Once when my father was fighting against some dragons, who were the scourge of our country, I slew the youngest dragon.
His mother, who was a witch, cast a spell over me and changed me into a Pig.
It was she who in the disguise of an old woman gave you the thread to bind round my foot.
So that instead of the three days that had to run before the spell was broken, I was forced to remain a Pig for three more years.
Now that we have suffered for each other, and have found each other again, let us forget the past.'
And in their joy they kissed one another.
Next morning they set out early to return to his father's kingdom.
Great was the rejoicing of all the people when they saw him and his wife; his father and his mother embraced them both, and there was feasting in the palace for three days and three nights.
Then they set out to see her father.
The old King nearly went out of his mind with joy at beholding his daughter again.
When she had told him all her adventures, he said to her:  'Did not I tell you that I was quite sure that that creature who wooed and won you as his wife had not been born a Pig?
You see, my child, how wise you were in doing what I told you.'
And as the King was old and had no heirs, he put them on the throne in his place.
And they ruled as only kings rule who have suffered many things.
And if they are not dead they are still living and ruling happily.
